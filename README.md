# video-controller
[Demo](https://praveshnexus.github.io/video-controller/)


Our project involves creating a movie trailer pop-up with an image, movie title, and Loren Ipsum text displayed on the page.
Clicking on the Watch Now button will open a video pop-up where. Closing the video will reset it to the 15-second mark,
but reopening it using the button will reset it to the beginning, at the zero-second mark.
We will use JavaScript to create these functionalities and add or remove the pop-up window.
The video tag of HTML will create the video player, and CSS will style it.
